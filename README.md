# outline-description
this is a program containing algorithms that describe an object

# how should the project be used?
1. You need to create a solid color background
2. Put an object on the background (the object color is different from the background color)
3. The light must be constant
4. Shadows are minimal

# potential problems
I am using Visual Studio 2019 when I wrote this project. So some of the details may have changed since then.
